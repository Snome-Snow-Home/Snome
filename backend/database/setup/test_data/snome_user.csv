I host a number of gorgeous homes, some in the beautiful Turks and Caicos Islands, British West Indies, a few lovely apartments in Tulum, the Magical Mayan Riviera of Mexico… And one in the beautiful Colorado Rockies' town of Aspen / Snowmass. Each one has its own unique style and ambiance which I’m proud to say I personally renovated and refurbished all of them myself. I am proud and love managing each of these apartments, so I can guarantee cleanliness and comfort, along with style and sophistication. I am also proud of all the great reviews I have received as a manager & host. I would always do anything to make your stay a great one.
