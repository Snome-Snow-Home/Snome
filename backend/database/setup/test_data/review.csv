1,1,4,1999-01-08 4:05:06,5,Victoria’s place is a gem! We were quite pleased with our stay and highly recommend it for others.
2,2,2,1999-01-08 4:06:06,4,"This is a perfect place for 2 couples or a family to stay. Even though there is only 1 bathroom, the tub/shower & toilet are in one room with a door, the sink is just outside the door, and there is yet another space with a mirror that is great for doing hair/makeup. The entry to the condo has a great space to keep ski gear. It was surprisingly quiet even during the weekend. I would choose to stay here again & absolutely recommend this condo to others!"

She provided multiple options of activities that we could enjoy with the kids. The unit was very clean, comfortable, and perfect for our family of 4."

7,7,4,1999-01-08 4:11:06,5,"Victoria's Place is great! Book it while you can! Fully stocked kitchen (and I mean fully- spices, pots, pans, cleaning supplies, silverware, placemats, etc), CLEAN, in a great location, cozy, and plenty of space for our family of 5. She even included a first aid kit which came in handy after our mountain biking crash. She has thought of many helpful details to make your stay easy and memorable. Great and timely communication as well ! Look no further for a place to stay in Vail!"

9,10,5,1999-01-08 4:13:06,4,This condo is very comfortable and chic with a well appointed kitchen for any cooking you might want to do. The location is very convenient. Loved having morning coffee on the deck and star gazing at night. Quiet but friendly neighbors. Victoria’s communication is superb.
