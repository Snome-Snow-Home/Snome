2,Jerry Seinfeld,June ,October,2.jpg,"Hello Airbnb'ers! I host a number of gorgeous homes, some in the beautiful Turks and Caicos Islands, British West Indies, a few lovely apartments in Tulum, the Magical Mayan Riviera of Mexico… And one in the beautiful Colorado Rockies' town of Aspen / Snowmass. Each one has its own unique style and ambiance which I’m proud to say I personally renovated and refurbished all of them myself. I am proud and love managing each of these apartments, so I can guarantee cleanliness and comfort, along with style and sophistication. I am also proud of all the great reviews I have received as a manager & host. I would always do anything to make your stay a great one. I love the adventure of traveling and looking forward to hosting you in one of my precious paradise gems! Happy travels!",

It's great to have guests enjoy our space while we're away. We love to hike and ski, dance and surf. You can get more of a sense of me as a teacher and read my blog if you search for ""Chloe Conger yoga.""",
